main.sh:

---

```
let index=0
let undivis=0

while read line; do
	let index=(index + 1)
	if [ $(( index % 3 )) -eq 0 ]; then
		echo $line
	else
		let undivis=(undivis+1)
	fi
done

if [ $undivis -gt 10 ]; then
	echo big
else
	echo small
fi
```

This program loops through all the lines in an input file (default is stdin, but can use < to route a file to stdin) and prints the line if and only if the index of that line is divisible by 3. Otherwise it increments the number of undivisible lines by 1.

At the end of the program, it checks the count of undivisible by 3 lines. If there were more than 10, it prints big. Otherwise, it prints small.

Example: ```./main.sh < file.txt```
